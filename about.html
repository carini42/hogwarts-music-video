      <h1>Hogwarts.<br /><span>Castle</span></h1>
      <p>
        Hogwarts was founded around AD 993 by two wizards, Godric Gryffindor and
        Salazar Slytherin, and two witches, Helga Hufflepuff and Rowena
        Ravenclaw. Each of them contained an aspect of personality they wanted
        in new students. However, shortly after the school was founded,
        Slytherin argued with the other founders about blood purity. Slytherin
        wanted to admit only pureblood students, while the other three founders
        disagreed. Slytherin left school soon after secretly building the
        Chamber of Secrets. When his or her true heir, the Slytherin Heir,
        returned to school, he or she would be able to open the Chamber and
        release the monster there in order to purify the school of all
        Muggleborn students.

        <br /><br />

        Hogwarts School is housed by Hogwarts Castle, a large castle located in
        an unknown location in Scotland, near the wizarding village of
        Hogsmeade. The castle has extensive grounds covered with grass and
        flowering shrubs and vegetable gardens, a lake, dense forest, several
        greenhouses and a Quidditch stadium. The castle also houses an owlery,
        which houses all the owls owned by the school and students. The three
        tallest towers are the Astronomy Tower, the Gryffindor Tower and the
        Ravenclaw Tower, respectively. There are 142 flights of stairs, which
        are known to move, in the castle, which was built on huge rocks over the
        lake. The castle is known for the many changes it has undergone to its
        structure over the years, as well as rebuilding itself after the Battle
        of Hogwarts.

        <br /><br />

        The Hogwarts coat of arms shows the animal symbol of each house and its
        colors. These are, clockwise from top left: the Gryffindor lion, the
        Slytherin snake, the Ravenclaw eagle and the Hufflepuff badger. Some
        rooms in the school tend to move, as do the steps in the Grand
        Staircase. Albus Dumbledore once claimed that he did not know all of the
        castle's secrets, as the site witnessed centuries of ancient magic.

        <br /><br />

        The school has a considerable amount of spells and enchantments around
        it so you can't find yourself by a muggle. Certain people cannot see the
        school, they only see ruins and various warning signs. Witches and
        wizards cannot Apparate or Disapparate at Hogwarts, except when the
        Headmaster removes the enchantment. Electricity and electronic devices
        don't work at Hogwarts. Radios, however, are an exception.
